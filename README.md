# Battleships-Web-Retry

##What is it? 
A rehash of my original project which was an online visual version of the classic game Battleships. The game engine has been cloned from [Stephen Lloyd](https://github.com/stephenlloyd) 

##Objectives?
* Consolidate some of what I learnt before on the previous project
* See if I could overcome some of my problems now I'm more aware of the problem scope
* Really get to grips with server routing and communication between front and back end

###To run:

```
bundle install
```

Tests:
```
rspec
```
[Localhost server](localhost:9292):
```
rackup
```

##Brief

* Allow a player to type in their name and register to play
* Lay out a board on the screen on which a player can place their ships
* Integrate all of this properly with the back-end logic

##Technologies
* Sinatra
* Ruby
* RSpec
* Cucumber
